# Movie Recommendation System Using Sentimental Analysis with Collaborative Filtering

## About the Project
The Movie Recommendation System is a data science project that leverages sentimental analysis and collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies to users. This project is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks and aims to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and reviews.

## Features
- **Sentimental Analysis:** Analyzes user reviews to understand the sentiment behind them, which helps in recommending movies that align with user preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Data Visualization:** Provides insightful visualizations to represent the recommendation process and user preferences.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Uses Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data analysis and model development.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Collects user reviews and movie ratings data.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses the data to make it suitable for analysis.
3. **Sentimental Analysis:** Applies sentimental analysis on user reviews to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of each review.
4. **Collaborative Filtering:** Implements collaborative filtering algorithms to find similarities between users and recommend movies based on these similarities.
5. **Recommendation Generation:** Combines the results of sentimental analysis and collaborative filtering to generate personalized movie recommendations for users.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DhanushSM/movies-recommandation-using-sentimental-analysis-with-colabrative-filtering-using-machine-learning-.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd movies-recommandation-using-sentimental-analysis-with-colabrative-filtering-using-machine-learning-
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the project directory to explore the data analysis and recommendation workflows.
- Follow the steps in the notebooks to perform data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and model development.
- Modify the notebooks as needed to experiment with different data sets and models.
